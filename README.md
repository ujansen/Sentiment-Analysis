# Sentiment-Analysis
Using NLP to perform Sentiment Analysis

Natural Language Processing is one of the strongest and most difficult Machine Learning fields out there and here, I've used a dataset of 50k IMDb reviews to train my model to predict whether a review is positive or negative.

The NLP model I used was the famous Bag of Words model, and you can read more about the Bag of Words model here: https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-explanation-of-the-bag-of-words-model-b88fc4f4971

The model was trained on 40000 samples and was then tested on the remaining 10000 samples using two classification algorithms which gave me the best accuracy scores.

Since it is a hassle to clean the data every single time someone wants to run the code, I have also uploaded the cleaned dataset as a .csv file which you are welcome to use to test out your algorithms.
